### `textDocument/prepareRename` Command in LSP

The `textDocument/prepareRename` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to ask the server whether the symbol at the given text document position would be valid for a rename operation.

#### Purpose

The `textDocument/prepareRename` command helps developers identify whether a certain symbol or identifier is valid for renaming. This is particularly useful during code refactoring where a developer may need to change the name of variables, methods, classes, etc. to improve code clarity or organization.

#### Example Scenario

Consider you have the variable `oldName` at a certain position in a `main.js` file and you want to check if it can be renamed.

#### Request Structure

The request for `textDocument/prepareRename` typically includes the text document identifier and the position of the symbol in the document.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "textDocument/prepareRename",
  "params": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///path/to/main.js"
    },
    "position": {
      "line": 15,
      "character": 7
    }
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `uri` specifies the location of the file.
- `position` specifies the position in the document where the symbol occurring.

#### Response Structure

The response will include a Range of the symbol being renamed and optionally a placeholder text of the symbol being renamed.

A `false` can be returned if a rename operation is not valid at the given position.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "range": {
      "start": {
        "line": 15,
        "character": 6
      },
      "end": {
        "line": 15,
        "character": 13
      }
    },
    "placeholder": "oldName"
  }
}
```

In this response:
- `range` specifies the range in the document of the symbol to be renamed.
- `placeholder` is the original name of the symbol, which could be replaced by a new name.

### Summary

The `textDocument/prepareRename` request in LSP helps developers to perform a preliminary check to verify if renaming a selected symbol is valid. It enhances the code refactoring process by providing feedback on potential renaming operations.
