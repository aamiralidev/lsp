### Workspace / Inlay Hint / Refresh

The `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to manually refresh inline/inlay hints. These are small hints that can be inserted by the language server into the text document to help developers grasp the code more effectively.

#### Purpose

The main purpose of `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` is to reevaluate the conditions and data of the source code and generate updated inline hints accordingly. This can be useful especially in cases where changes have been made to the source code and the inline hints are no longer accurate and need to be refreshed.

#### Example Scenario

For instance, consider a programmer working on a Rust source file. After several changes to the variables and their types, the programmer wants the inline type annotations to be refreshed to mirror the current state of the code.

#### Request Structure

The request for `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` does not require any particular parameters, as it's effectively a command to the language server to perform the refresh operation.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "workspace/inlayHint/refresh",
  "params": {}
}
```
In this request, there's no specific parameter. The command simply instructs the language server to refresh the inline hints.

#### Response Structure

This request typically does not have a response. Upon receiving the `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` request, the language server refreshes the inlay hints, but does not send a response.



### Summary

The `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` request in LSP is designed to refresh the inline hints in the code when a developer makes changes. This command is especially helpful when the code gets updated, ensuring that the inline hints stay current and continue to assist developers in understanding the code easier. It does not require any parameters and typically produces no response. It simply triggers the language server to perform the specified task.
