### Exit

#### Purpose
The `exit` request enables clean and safe termination of the language server. It ensures that any ongoing tasks are completed and important data is saved before the server is shut down, avoiding any unwanted loss of data.

#### Example Scenario

Suppose a developer is working on a programming project using a coding editor that uses LSP. At the end of the day, the developer decides to close the coding editor. At this point, the editor would first send a `shutdown` request, then immediately after the response is received, it would send an `exit` request to the language server.

#### Request Structure

The `exit` request does not have a defined set of parameters. It's an empty notification sent from the client side.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "exit"
}
```

In this request:
- `jsonrpc` is a version marker indicating that the request is a JSON-RPC 2.0 notification.
- `method` specifies the type of request, in this case `exit`.

#### Response Structure

The `exit` request is a notification and hence, does not return any response object.

#### Example Response

As previously stated, an `exit` notification does not return any response object. Instead, the server is expected to close down immediately without sending any response.

### Summary

The `exit` request in LSP is a notification sent by the client to the server requesting it to shut down safely. It allows the server to complete any ongoing tasks and preserve any crucial data before closing. It is typically sent immediately after a `shutdown` request, once the client has received the response for the `shutdown` request.
