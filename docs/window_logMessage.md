### `window/logMessage` Command in LSP

The `window/logMessage` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used by the language server to push log messages to the client. These messages indicate details about the server s execution and its internal state. 

#### Purpose

The purpose of the `window/logMessage` command is to relay information from the language server to the client. These might be messages about errors, warnings or just general status updates. This can be particularly handy in debugging and diagnosing problems within the language server.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine a scenario where the language server needs to process a complex request and wants to send multiple status updates to inform the client about the ongoing process. The server can use `window/logMessage` for this purpose.

#### Request Structure

The `window/logMessage` does not follow a traditional request-response structure. Instead, it is a one-way message from the server to the client. It includes two fields: "type" and "message".

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "window/logMessage",
  "params": {
    "type": 3,
    "message": "3 files processed"
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `type` is the message type. This can be a number from 1-4, representing error, warning, info, and log respectively. Here, type 3 indicates an info message.
- `message` is the actual content of the message.

#### Response Structure

As mentioned above, `window/logMessage` does not trigger a response from the client to the server. The client usually processes these messages by displaying them in a log or console output.

### Summary

The `window/logMessage` command is a method by which the LSP server can display important information to the client. This can include diagnostic messages and status updates, which can be particularly helpful for debugging.
