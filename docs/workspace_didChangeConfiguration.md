### Workspace / Did Change Configuration

The `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is sent by the client to the server to indicate changes in configuration settings. LSP enables integration of text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) with services (servers) that provide language features like autocomplete, go to definition, find all references etc.

#### Purpose

The `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification is used to signal the language server that settings have changed. This helps to keep the server's understanding of the environment up-to-date, which in turn allows it adjust its processing according to new settings.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine you are working in a TypeScript project and you have a language server running that uses a particular set of rules for linting your TypeScript code. If you change these rules in your IDE, the client (IDE) will use `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification to inform the server of these changes, allowing it to update its linting process accordingly.

#### Notification Structure

This is a notification, not a request, so it does not need a response. The notification includes the settings object that has changed.

**Notification:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "workspace/didChangeConfiguration",
  "params": {
    "settings": {
      "typescript": {
        "tslint": {
          "enable": true,
          "rules": {
            "no-any": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this notification:
- `settings` is the object that contains the updated configuration. Here, `typescript` represents the language and `tslint` is a linter tool configuration for TypeScript. The new setting disables the rule `no-any`.

#### Summary

The `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification in LSP is crucial for informing the server about any changes in client settings. This ensures that the server accurately understands the context in which it is operating and can provide the most relevant and accurate language features.
