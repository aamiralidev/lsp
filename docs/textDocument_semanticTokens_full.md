### Text Document / Semantic Tokens / Full

The `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to fetch semantic tokens for a whole file. Semantic tokens provide a structured portrayal of the syntax in a file, allowing entities like variables, functions, classes etc., to be categorized according to predefined standard types and modifiers.

#### Purpose

The `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` command helps developer tools to track syntax and semantics of code elements which aids in improving readability and context understanding. This function is especially useful for colorization schemes in editors, code analysis, and other language tooling support.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine you have a JavaScript file and you want to fetch all the semantic tokens in that file.

#### Request Structure

The request for `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` generally includes the text document identifier.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "textDocument/semanticTokens/full",
  "params": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///path/to/file.js"
    }
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `uri` specifies the location of the file.

#### Response Structure

The response will include an array of integers representing semantic tokens. Each token is represented by five numbers: deltaLine, deltaStart, length, tokenType, and tokenModifiers.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "data": [
      0, 0, 11, 2, 0,  // "function" at l:1, c:1, length: 11
      0, 12, 7, 1, 0,  // "myFunc" at l:1, c:13, length: 7
      1, 0, 3, 2, 0,  // "var" at l:2, c:1, length: 3
      0, 4, 4, 1, 0  // "name" at l:2, c:5, length: 4
    ]
  }
}
```

In this response:
- Each tuple of five integers represents a semantic token.
- The first two numbers represent the difference in line and character from the previous token, the third number is the length of the token, the fourth number is the type of the token, and the fifth number represents any modifiers applied to the token.

### Summary

The `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` request in LSP retrieves semantic tokens for a file which provides a structured representation of the syntax in the file. This information assists in syntax highlighting, code comprehension, and other development tooling features.
