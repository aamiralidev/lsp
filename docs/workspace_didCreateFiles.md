### `workspace/didCreateFiles` Command in LSP

The `workspace/didCreateFiles` notification in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to inform the language server that certain files have been created. Since this is a notification, not a request, the server will not send any response back.

#### Purpose

The `workspace/didCreateFiles` command allows the language server to maintain a synchronized understanding of the file system's state as seen by the client. This is especially useful for maintaining project-wide analysis or caches that rely on understanding the complete set of files in a workspace.

#### Example Scenario

Imagine you have an LSP client integrated into an IDE, and you create a new file named `newfile.js` in your workspace. The IDE will send a `workspace/didCreateFiles` notification to the language server to let it know that `newfile.js` has been created.

#### Notification Structure

The notification for `workspace/didCreateFiles` typically includes an array of `CreateFile`s in the parameters where each `CreateFile` object typically consists of a `uri` pointing to the location of the file.

**Notification:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "workspace/didCreateFiles",
  "params": {
    "changes": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///path/to/newfile.js"
      },
      {
        "uri": "file:///path/to/anothernewfile.js"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this notification:
- `changes` is an array of `CreateFile` objects.
- `uri` specifies the location of the newly created file.

#### No Response Structure

Since `workspace/didCreateFiles` is a notification and not a request, the server does not send a response back to the client. 

### Summary

The `workspace/didCreateFiles` notification in LSP is a key part of maintaining synchronization between the client's and server's understanding of the workspace file system state. This allows the server to keep track of changes and updates in the workspace used for project-wide analyses or caches.
