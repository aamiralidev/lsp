### `notebookDocument/didClose` Command in LSP

The `notebookDocument/didClose` notification in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) comprises the beginnings of LSP's support for the editor environment. The notification informs the server that the client has closed the specified notebook document. It is only sent if the server has the `notebookProvider` capability.

#### Purpose

The main purpose of the `notebookDocument/didClose` command is to inform the server to perform any necessary cleaning up since a notebook document is no longer open in the client. This may involve the server freeing up resources or cancellation of language-specific activities.

#### Example Scenario

Consider you have an active Jupyter notebook document in VS Code. When you close this notebook document, VS code issues a `notebookDocument/didClose` notification to notify the language server that the notebook has been closed.

#### Request Structure

The request for `notebookDocument/didClose` typically includes the text document identifier.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notebookDocument/didClose",
  "params": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///path/to/Notebook.ipynb"
    }
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `uri` specifies the location of the notebook file.

#### Response Structure

`notebookDocument/didClose` is a notification, not a request, which means it does not have a direct response from the server. The operation performed by the server upon receipt of this command is dependent on its implementation details, and will not result in a response.

### Summary

The `notebookDocument/didClose` notification in the LSP informs the server that a notebook document was closed by the client. The server might take this information to free up resources or execute language-specific clean-up. This notification is not a request and does not result directly in a response. Instead, it typically triggers server-side operations and updates.
