### `textDocument/moniker` Command in LSP

The `textDocument/moniker` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to compute monikers for a symbol at a given text document position. A moniker is essentially an identifier that helps to uniquely identify a symbol within the workspace or across different workspaces.

#### Purpose

The `textDocument/moniker` command is designed to help developers trace the origin of a particular code symbol such as a variable, method, or class across different systems or tools, even across different projects or workspaces. It is especially useful in a development environment with many codebases or repositories.

#### Example Scenario

Suppose you are exploring a large-scale project in Visual Studio Code, and you'd like to trace specific variables, methods, or classes across the project's numerous, possibly interrelated, files. The `textDocument/moniker` command could be used to retrieve the moniker of the symbol, making it easier to navigate or trace the same symbol across different files.

#### Request Structure

The request for `textDocument/moniker` mainly includes the text document identifier and the position within the document where the command is initiated.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "textDocument/moniker",
  "params": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///path/to/source_code.js"
    },
    "position": {
      "line": 18,
      "character": 5
    }
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `uri` specifies the location of the source document.
- `position` indicates the specific position of the symbol for which to compute the moniker.

#### Response Structure

The response would include an array of monikers for the symbol at the specified position.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": [
    {
      "kind": "import",
      "scheme": "npm",
      "identifier": "lodash",
      "unique": "true"
    },
    {
      "kind": "local",
      "scheme": "file",
      "identifier": "calculateTotal",
      "unique": "false"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this response:
- `kind` can represent different things, such as 'import', 'export', 'local' etc.
- `scheme` is the scheme of the moniker.
- `identifier` is the unique identifier that represents the symbol.
- `unique` is a flag indicating if this moniker is unique across all documents.

### Summary

The `textDocument/moniker` request in LSP provides a powerful interface for developers to compute unique identifiers for symbols in a codebase. This streamlines the process of navigating across large-scale or interrelated projects.
