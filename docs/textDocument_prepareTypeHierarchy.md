### Text Document / Prepare Type Hierarchy

The `textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to prepare the type hierarchy information for a given location (symbol) in a specific text document. It forms the basis for the Type Hierarchy feature in supported IDEs, enabling developers to investigate and navigate through inheritance relationships and implementers of an interface.

#### Purpose

The `textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy` command helps developers gain an in-depth understanding of inheritance structures and interface implementations in their code. It is particularly useful for object-oriented programming languages where inheritance and interface implementation are common.

#### Example Scenario

Assume you are working with a class called `Employee` in a file named `employee.js` and you want to find out its parent and child classes (derived from it).

#### Request Structure

The request for `textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy` typically includes the text document identifier and the position identifying the symbol.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy",
  "params": {
    "textDocument": {
      "uri": "file:///path/to/employee.js"
    },
    "position": {
      "line": 15,
      "character": 5
    }
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `uri` is the location of the file.
- `position` specifies the cursor position in the document where the `Employee` class is defined.

#### Response Structure

The response is an array of TypeHierarchyItem, each representing a type in the hierarchy.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    {
      "data": null,
      "detail": null,
      "kind": 5,
      "name": "Employee",
      "uri": "file:///path/to/employee.js",
      "range": {
        "start": {
          "line": 15,
          "character": 2
        },
        "end": {
          "line": 20,
          "character": 0
        }
      },
      "selectionRange": {
        "start": {
          "line": 15,
          "character": 2
        },
        "end": {
          "line": 15,
          "character": 10
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "data": null,
      "detail": null,
      "kind": 5,
      "name": "Manager",
      "uri": "file:///path/to/manager.js",
      "range": {
        "start": {
          "line": 4,
          "character": 0
        },
        "end": {
          "line": 25,
          "character": 0
        }
      },
      "selectionRange": {
        "start": {
          "line": 4,
          "character": 0
        },
        "end": {
          "line": 4,
          "character": 8
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this response:
- `name` is the name of the type.
- `kind` is the kind of type (5 represents Class).
- `uri` is the file where the type is defined.
- `range` is the range in the document where the type definition starts and ends.
- `selectionRange` is the range covering the type identifier.

### Summary

The `textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy` request in LSP is a helpful tool for developers to understand the type hierarchy and navigate through inheritance structures efficiently. It provides a tree of types (classes, interfaces) related to a specific type which aids in code comprehension and refactoring.
