### Window / Show Message

The `window/showMessage` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a command that the server sends to the client in order to ask it to display a particular message, typically in a pop-up window.

#### Purpose

The `window/showMessage` command is typically used by a language server to communicate information, warnings, errors, or other messages to the client. This can be used to inform users about issue during language analysis tasks, like compile errors or deprecated methods.

#### Example Scenario

For instance, let's assume that there is a syntax error detected by a language server in a document. The server can use the `window/showMessage` request to display a pop-up with the error message to the user.

#### Request Structure

The request for `window/showMessage` includes the type of the message and the message itself.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "window/showMessage",
  "params": {
    "type": 1,
    "message": "Syntax error detected: Unexpected token"
  }
}
```

In this request:
- `type` specifies the type of the message, which can be one of the following values: 1 (error), 2 (warning), 3 (info), or 4 (log).
- `message` is the text of the message to be displayed.

#### Response Structure

Since `window/showMessage` is a notification type message, no direct response is expected in the protocol. The client receives the notification and handles it appropriately, typically displaying the message in its user interface.

#### Summary

The `window/showMessage` request is a notification type command in LSP that is sent by the server to the client to display certain messages. These could be errors, warnings, or other relevant information. It's a communication mechanism between the server and the user via the client.
