### Workspace / Diagnostic / Refresh

The `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` request in the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is used to request the refresh of all diagnostics information in the workspace. This command aims to sync the new diagnostics data from server side to the client side.

#### Purpose

The purpose of the `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` command is to keep diagnostics data up to date. It is especially valuable when there are changes in the codebase, and we want to re-evaluate the entire set of diagnostics data.

#### Example Scenario

Let's say you are working on a large project with multiple files. After making extensive changes, you would want to ensure that the diagnostics data, like errors, warnings, etc., is updated across all the workspace. 

#### Request Structure

The request for `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` does not require any parameters.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "workspace/diagnostic/refresh",
  "params": {}
}
```

In this request, the `method` field specifies that a refresh of the workspace diagnostics data is being requested.

#### Response Structure

The response for `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` is usually an acknowledgement message.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": "Diagnostics Refreshed"
}
```

In this response, the `result` field carries a message confirming the successful execution of the `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` request.

### Summary

The `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` request in LSP helps developers to keep diagnostics data for the whole workspace up-to-date. By triggering a complete refresh of the diagnostics data, this command ensures that the latest state of the codebase is considered when performing diagnostics.
